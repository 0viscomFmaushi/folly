If you own a Navigon MN6.5 GPS device, you might want to update it with the latest maps of Europe for better navigation and accuracy. Navigon MN6.5 is a software version that runs on various GPS devices, such as TomTom, Destinator and Navigon[^4^] [^5^]. It offers features like Reality View, which shows realistic images of junctions and exits[^6^]. However, the maps can get outdated over time, so you need to download and install the newest ones periodically.
 
In this article, we will show you how to update your Navigon MN6.5 GPS device with the Q3 2012 Europe maps, which are the most recent ones available as of April 2023. These maps cover 40 countries in Europe and include updated roads and streets[^3^]. You will need a computer with an internet connection, a USB cable and a microSD card with at least 4 GB of free space.
