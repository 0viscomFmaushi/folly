## What is Picture Instruments Image 2 LUT Pro 5.2.7 (64-bit)?
  
Picture Instruments Image 2 LUT Pro 5.2.7 (64-bit) is a software that allows you to create color grading presets from any image you like, and apply them to your own images or footage. You can use any image as a source of inspiration, such as a movie still, a poster, a painting, or even a photo from your own camera.
  
The software analyzes the colors and tones of the source image, and generates a look that matches its style and mood. You can then load a reference image or video into the target area, and see how the look is applied to it. You can also adjust the intensity of the look, its influence on skin tones, its contrast, and its saturation.
  
Once you are happy with the result, you can save the reference image or video along with the look as a file on your computer, or export it as a 3D LUT for further use in other photo and video editing software. A 3D LUT is a file that contains information about how to map colors from one image to another, and it can be used by many popular programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, and more.
