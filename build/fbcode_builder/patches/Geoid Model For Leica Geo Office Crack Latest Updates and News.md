# How to Install a Geoid Model for Leica Geo Office
 
Leica Geo Office is a software that allows you to manage and process geospatial data from Leica instruments. One of the features of Leica Geo Office is the ability to use a geoid model, which is a representation of the shape and size of Earth that approximates the mean sea level. A geoid model can help you improve the accuracy of your elevation measurements and coordinate transformations.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install a geoid model for Leica Geo Office using a simple step-by-step guide. You will need to have Leica Geo Office installed on your computer and a geoid model file downloaded from the internet or provided by your local survey authority.

## Step 1: Locate the Geoid Model File
 
The first step is to locate the geoid model file that you want to install. The file should have a .ggf extension and contain the geoid model data in a binary format. You can download geoid models from various sources online, such as [NOAA](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID/), [EPSG](https://www.epsg.org/), or [EUREF](https://www.euref.eu/). Alternatively, you can use a geoid model file that was provided by your local survey authority or obtained from another source.
 
Once you have the geoid model file, make sure to save it in a folder that is accessible by Leica Geo Office. For example, you can save it in the default folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Leica Geosystems\Leica Geo Office\Coordinate Systems\Geoids.
 
## Step 2: Open Leica Geo Office
 
The next step is to open Leica Geo Office on your computer. You can do this by clicking on the Leica Geo Office icon on your desktop or by searching for it in the Start menu. Once Leica Geo Office is open, you will see the main window with various tabs and options.
